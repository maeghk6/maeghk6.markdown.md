# Online Courses
You work late. You don't have time to attend night classes or aren't interested in going back to college. But you want to learn. Perhaps you need the certification, or maybe you just want to make your resume more competitive. There are many reasons why people choose to take online courses. With the increased emphasis on technology in recent decades, we now have dozens of online options available for continued learning. Many four year universities and community colleges are offering online courses, some of which are even free.

## Platforms
If you take an online class directly through a university, you are often charged a tuition fee to take part in the course. However there are many other available resources that provide online classes- either through museums or universities- for free. Here are just a few:

* **Coursera** - this website provides a huge amount of online courses through museums and universities from all over the world. Including such institutions as Yale, Duke, and the Museum of Modern Art, Coursera allows you to expand your knowledge on a broad range of applicable topics such as programing languages and neuroscience.

* **iTunes U** - run through iTunes, this program is similar to Coursera in that it offers a variety of free courses from universities, museums, and public media organizations around the world. You can download these lectures to any PC or mobile device and listen to them on the go.

* **Open Culture** - this website provides downloadable video and audio courses from a variety of well known universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Yale. With 1200 free courses and over 30,000 hours of material, this platform is sure to have something for everyone.

* **Public Libraries** - most public libraries have access to online courses and programs, especially centered around language learning. In addition to this, public libraries often house online courses in practical areas such as writing courses, personal finance, and business skills. They also have test preparation resources for the SAT, ACT, GRE, and LSAT.

## Important Things to Know
While taking online courses can be rewarding, it's important to realize that online classes have their limitations. Often, especially with free online courses, you don't get the resource and support of a physical instructor. If you're lucky, you might get an online professor who you can email with questions or participate in a chat room with other students. However, if you're just listening to an online lecture you won't have these kinds of resources. Here are a few tips to help keep you on top of your work if you don't have an easily accessible instructor.

* **Make a study schedule**: it's important that you stay on top of your work, particularly for an online course, as it's easy to procrastinate when there's not a class that requires your physical presence.
* ** *If you make a schedule*- STICK TO IT**: this may seem obvious, but it's a real issue many people have. In order to effectively take an online course, you need a lot of self-discipline to stay engaged in the work.
* **Find available resources**- if you don't
