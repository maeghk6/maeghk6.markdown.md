# Museum Musings
A lot of people think that museums are outdated things, repositories for dusty antiques and irrelevant artifacts. But museums are so much more than that. They are treasure troves, containing a myriad of wonders from ages past and mementos of current times in the hopes that they will benefit humanity in the future. When I was little, I loved to go to museums. The Virginia Living Museum was one of my favorites, filled with wildlife and all the mysteries of nature. I could have spent whole days there. Another favorite was the Children's Museum of Richmond. It had a huge sculpture outside by the entrance, like to large metal plates. When you spoke near them the sound reverberated all around you. It was like magic, and the inside of the museum was a wonderland. I had the time of my life there, simulating severe weather events and learning about electricity and all kinds of things. At the time of course, I didn't realize that I was learning. It was just having fun. But now that I've grown up I realize how important museums were to my childhood. They encouraged curiosity and helped me to be interested in learning outside of the classroom. But today museums are in trouble.
## The Problem
Libraries and museums get funding to operate through the Institute for Museums and Library Services (IMLS). This is the only federally dedicated money to support these institutions and in 2016 constituted only 0.00006% of the national budget. It seems like such a small amount to pay for all the services we get in return, doesn't it?
